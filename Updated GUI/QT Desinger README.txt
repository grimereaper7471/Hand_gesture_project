Before starting, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. To install QT Designer to create GUI, 
follow these steps: Go to their website and search for QT Designer.
Download the appropriate version for your operating system. Open the command prompt and type "pip install pyqt5-tools". 
Navigate to the location where you have installed Python with the pip packages. Open the "Lib" folder, then the "site-packages" folder, and find the "pyqt5-tools" folder.
Find the QT Designer application and create a quick access tool for it.

To convert a "somethingname.ui" file from QT Designer into a Python file, follow these steps: Save the "somethingname.ui" file. 
In the command prompt, type "pyuic5 -x somethingname.ui -o somethingname.py".
 A new Python file will appear in the same location, ready to be opened in Visual Studio Code.
